This repository contains a JavaScript code snippet demonstrating a subtle bug related to division by zero and its improved solution. The original code incorrectly returns 0 when one of the inputs is zero, masking a potential division-by-zero error. The solution addresses this issue by explicitly handling cases where either input is zero, providing more robust error handling and output.
